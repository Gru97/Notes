I have some very interesting questions regarding agile, product, and these kinds of concepts in software development process. Having some years of experience working in teams to deliver software, these come to my mind. 

### Being Agile
I keep hearing this in interviews that "we are an agile company". But based on what criteria can we say that a company or a team is agile?   
There are some question we can ask from the interviewer to gain insight about how teams operate in the organization:

* How do you prioritize and manage work?   
Agile teams typically use frameworks like Scrum or Kanban to manage their work. Ask about their approach to backlog management, sprint planning, and how they handle changing priorities. Look for indications of iterative and incremental development.   

* How do you involve stakeholders and customers?   
Agile teams prioritize customer collaboration and feedback. Ask about their practices for involving stakeholders and customers in the development process. Inquire about their methods for gathering feedback and how they incorporate it into their work.   

* How do you handle changes and adaptability?    
Agility is about embracing change. Ask about how the team deals with changing requirements or scope. Look for their ability to adapt and iterate based on feedback and new insights.   

* How do you ensure continuous improvement?
Agile teams have a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Ask about their retrospective practices and how they use feedback to refine their processes. Look for indications of experimentation and a willingness to try new approaches.   

* How do you collaborate and communicate within the team?   
Collaboration and communication are key aspects of agility. Ask about their communication channels, practices for cross-functional collaboration, and how they ensure transparency within the team.

* How do you measure and track progress?   
Agile teams often use metrics and visualizations to track their progress. Ask about their use of metrics, such as velocity or lead time, and how they use them to improve their performance.

* How do you empower and support the team?   
Agile teams thrive in an environment of trust and empowerment. Ask about how leadership supports and enables the team. Inquire about their approach to autonomy, decision-making, and removing obstacles.

### Issues In (so-called) Agile Teams    
There are some issues I have faced as a developer in teams practicing agile.   
* Task readiness
* Task clearity   
Possible Solution:   
  * Collaborative requirements gathering: Involve developers in the requirements gathering process to ensure a shared understanding between the PO, manager, and the development team. Encourage the PO and manager to include developers in discussions or meetings regarding new tasks to clarify requirements and gather insights.
  * Clear acceptance criteria and definition of done: Ensure that each task has well-defined acceptance criteria and a clear definition of done. These criteria should be agreed upon by the team and the responsible stakeholders. This helps developers understand exactly what is expected of them and ensures that tasks are considered ready for development.

* Frequently changing priorities
  
* Lack of involvment of developers in planning/ lack of frequent daily standups when practicing scrum
Shows limited collaboration and communication: Daily standups and involving developers in planning are essential for fostering collaboration and communication within the team. If these practices are absent, it may indicate a lack of emphasis on teamwork and effective communication. This could lead to silos of information, reduced visibility into the progress of work, and potential misalignment between team members.

* Tasks being assigned to team members
Shows command and control management style: Assigning tasks to individuals without their input may suggest a command and control management style, where decisions and task assignments are made by higher-level managers or team leads. This approach can limit autonomy and ownership among team members and may result in reduced motivation and engagement.

* Imbalances in workload among team members   
What it shows?
  * silos and lack of cross-functional collaboration: The team may be operating in silos, with each product having its own set of owners and limited collaboration between them. This can result in a lack of flexibility and resource sharing, leading to imbalances in workload and work pressure among different teams.

  * Lack of a holistic team mindset: If individuals are not assigned tasks on products outside of their ownership group, it may suggest a lack of a holistic team mindset. This means that team members prioritize their own product's tasks over the overall team's needs. This can lead to suboptimal resource allocation and hinder the team's ability to respond effectively to changing priorities or workloads.

  * Inefficient utilization of resources: If individuals have nothing to do during a sprint while another team is under work pressure, it indicates an inefficient utilization of resources. The team may not be effectively leveraging the skills and availability of team members to balance the workload across products and ensure optimal productivity.   

  * Limited flexibility and adaptability: Assigning tasks without considering individual skills, interests, or workload can lead to suboptimal task allocation. It may result in team members being assigned tasks that are not aligned with their strengths or that overload them with work. This lack of flexibility and adaptability can impact productivity and overall team performance.

________________________________

Once a manager told me, "Why would I involve the whole team in developing a feature/product when I can do it with one team member"?     
This mindset can be good for the organizations that want to spend less budget on resources and it helps with efficiency. But when you have a team at hand, it's important to have a balance between efficiency and collaboration. While involving more people may require additional coordination and communication, the benefits of collaboration often outweigh the potential efficiency gains of working with just one person.
What are values of team work?   
  * Collaboration and knowledge sharing: Involving more people in a job or task can bring diverse perspectives, expertise, and ideas to the table. Collaboration allows for knowledge sharing, learning, and innovation. It can lead to better problem-solving, improved decision-making, and higher-quality outcomes.
  * Workload distribution and capacity management: Involving more people can help distribute the workload and prevent overburdening individuals. It allows for better capacity management, ensuring that tasks are completed within reasonable timeframes and without causing burnout or stress for any team member.
  * Redundancy and resilience: Having multiple people involved in a job or task provides redundancy and resilience. If one team member is unavailable due to illness, vacation, or other reasons, the work can still progress smoothly with others stepping in. It reduces the risk of bottlenecks and delays.
  * Skill development and growth: Involving more people in a job or task provides opportunities for skill development and growth. It allows team members to learn from each other, expand their knowledge, and develop new capabilities. It can contribute to a more well-rounded and versatile team.
  * Collaborative decision-making and ownership: Involving more people in a job or task promotes collaborative decision-making and shared ownership. It fosters a sense of collective responsibility and accountability, leading to increased engagement and commitment from team members.
