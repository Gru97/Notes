I have some very interesting questions regarding agile, product, and concepts in software development process. 

1. I keep hearing this in interviews that "we are an agile company". But based on what criteria can we say that a company or a team is agile?
2. What is the difference between project and product? Project management and product management?
3. What is the role of a scrum master in a scrum team?
4. What is the idea behind DevOps? What is the correct way of applying this idea in product development teams?
