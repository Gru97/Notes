## A personal summary of *The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team* by *Patrick Lencioni*

This book is important because it talks about issues related to people working as a team. As it is said in agile, individuals and interactions are more important than processes and tools.
According to the book, the five dysfunctions of a team are as follows:
### 1. Trust
Trusting in a team means you believe your teammate is good and means good. To have trust, you need to be vulnerable instead of being defensive and careful.
Vulnerability means to risk being seen, flaws and all. 
It's important that leaders practice vulnerability so that others learn by example.
Some personal examples for myself would be being able to make mistakes, being able to say you don't have enough knowledge in a specific area, or you need help with a task without being judged, being criticized or shamed.
### 2. Fear of conflict
We need to change our mindset about conflicts. Conflict is an opportunity to grow. We tend to avoid confronting others because we are afraid we might hurt them, especially when that relationship matters to us. But avoidance results in tension between teammates.
Some people think conflicts are a waste of time, and we should just let things go. But the tension  of avoiding them wastes even more time and energy in the team.
We should acknowledge that conflict is productive, and conflict resolution is necessary.

### 3. Lack of commitment
This one drives from the need for consensus(that we should all agree on one thing) or certainty
It's important that in a team, everyone feels heard and considered. It doesn't matter if the ultimate decision is not agreed upon by all members.
It's important to make decisions even if we don't have all the knowledge or that we might be wrong. A wrong decision is better than not making any decision. Inability to make a decision creates lack of confidence.
Having deadline for decision-making and considering worst case scenario helps. Leaders must be comfortable making wrong decisions.
### 4. Avoidance of accountability
This one comes from fear of holding one another accountable to not jeopardize a valuable personal relationship. Ironically, this approach damages relationships because people start resenting one another because of unmet expectations. 
What helps people stay accountable is the fear of letting down their teammates.
What we expect from others should be totally clear.
### 5. Inattention to results
